								<p>From the given framework and the given tutorials, I have developed a similar style game to Pacman which has the key concepts of the original Pacman game. Although movement is important for almost any game, Pacman has a different and specific of movement that makes it so he can only move along one axis at a time – meaning that he can’t move diagonally. A simple form of collision of collision detection was made because the window size was limited to 1024x768, so I made it possible for Pacman to be able to wrap around the screen. Bounding box collision was created for the randomly spawning munchies so that Pacman can eat them and will increase the user’s score. There is also a cherry that Pacman can eat which will give a significant amount of score. Another important concept from the Pacman game are the Ghosts that can kill Pacman if they manage to touch him. Three different menus were created: start, pause and death; almost every game will have this. A start screen was made where the user can press the “SPACEBAR” key to start the game. A pause screen was made where the user can press the “P” key to pause the game and press it again to resume. When Pacman dies, a death typical death screen is displayed alongside the user’s ending score.</p>
